** Usage
- Install using your favorite package manager.
  /It's not published yet, you'd have to grab it directly from the repo./
  
- Use it: ~M-x wiktionary-bro-dwim~
  - =<TAB>= to collapse/expand sections
  - =RET= on Wiktionary links to navigate to that entry (opens in wiktionary-bro buffer)
  - =RET= on Wikipedia/external links to open in browser
  - =C-c C-l= to change the language and re-render the current entry (shows available languages)

- Pronunciation gets played via ffplay (typically bundled in ffmpeg), or you can set it to play through any other app by setting ~wiktionary-bro-audio-player~

- Note that the content won't be wrapped, this is done so the tables are rendered properly.

*** Multi-language support
- Set ~wiktionary-bro-language~ to change the default language (e.g., ="fr"= for French, ="de"= for German)
- In a wiktionary-bro buffer, press =C-c C-l= to change the language and re-render the entry
- The language picker shows only languages that have an entry for the current word
- Links within wiktionary-bro buffers respect the current language setting
