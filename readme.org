** Usage
- Install using your favorite package manager.
  /It's not published yet, you'd have to grab it directly from the repo./
  
- Use it: ~M-x wiktionary-bro-dwim~
  - =<TAB>= to collapse/expand sections

- Pronunciation gets played via ffplay (typically bundled in ffmpeg), or you can set it to play through any other app by setting ~wiktionary-bro-audio-player~

- Note that the content won't be wrapped, this is done so the tables are rendered properly.
